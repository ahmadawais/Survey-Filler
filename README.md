# Survey Filler (Chrome Extension)

âœ… A One-Click survey/course feedback filler for University of Engineering and Technology (UET) LMS.

It is a Chrome extension that automatically detects whenever you are submitting surveys and provides
you 5 options to select from. Once selected, it fills all the answers saving your time. I created
this to avoid the frustation of selecting 30 radio buttons! ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¬
